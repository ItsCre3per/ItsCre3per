## Hi, I'm Creeper.
- I play Minecraft Java Edition, particularly on an Avatar themed server called EtherealCraft.
- I make ProjectKorra (a plugin themed around Avatar: The Last Airbender) move addons and Minecraft Java plugins.
- I love coding, and I make a lot of scattered projects. For example, my website, [itscre3per.github.io](https://itscre3per.github.io), has a game built into it called the LOTR Game that I made as a project one day for a class presentation. Feel free to try it out :D
- My YouTube channel can be found [here](https://youtube.com/@itscre3per) (subscribe if you're reading this :) )
- I code in:
    - Java
    - JavaScript
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Arduino
  ### Come join EtherealCraft. IP is:

  ***Have a good day.***
