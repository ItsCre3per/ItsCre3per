## Hi, I'm Creeper.
- I love Minecraft Java Edition, specifically an Avatar themed server called EtherealCraft.
- I make ProjectKorra (a plugin themed around Avatar: The Last Airbender) move addons and Minecraft Java plugins.
- My YouTube channel can be found here ([subscribe](https://youtube.com/@itscre3per)  if you're reading this lol)
- Languages I know:
    - Java
    - JavaScript
    - HTML & CSS
    - Arduino (a modified C)
    - Hopefully C++ in the future
